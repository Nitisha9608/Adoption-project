<div class="container">
<h1 align="center" >Who are the children waiting for adoption?</h1>
<h3 align="center" style="color: grey">More than 101,000 children wait for permanent homes in the United States. Most are school-aged or older. Many have emotional, physical, or learning disabilities. There are brothers and sisters who need to stay together. More than half of the children come from minority cultures.

<div class="jumbotron">
<h1 align="center" style="color: grey">Can I Ask for More Information about the Child I Want to Adopt?</h1>
<h3 align="center">Once you have been selected for a particular child, adoption agencies are required to share with you any information that they have about the child, with the exception of identifying information about the birth family. Unfortunately, they may not always have a great deal of information, especially if a child has lived in several foster homes

<div class="container">
<h1 align="center" >Can the Biological Parents Come Back to Take a Child?</h1>
<h3 align="center" style="color: grey">In order for a child to be adopted, the birth parents have to relinquish legal parental rights. With most agency adoptions, a child is already legally free for adoption before a placement occurs. While cases where a parent changes his/her mind (usually before an adoption is finalized) are highly publicized, they occur infrequently.

<div class="jumbotron">
<h1 align="center" style="color: grey">Can I Adopt a Child in a Different State?</h1>
<h3 align="center">Yes. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA), passed in 1998, requires state agencies to speed up a child's move from foster care to adoption by establishing time frames for permanency planning and guidelines for when a child must be legally freed for adoption. The law also removes geographic barriers to adoption by requiring that states not delay or deny a placement if an approved family is available outside the state.

</div>
<div class="container">
<h1 align="center" >How Does Foster Care Differ from Adoption?</h1>
<h3 align="center" style="color: grey">Foster care is meant to be temporary shelter for a child; generally the plan is for the child to return to the parents when they are able to provide care. If that fails, the child is made available for adoption.
 
Foster parents may be able to adopt the child in their care if the child becomes available, through a foster-adopt program with their agency. In fact, most adoptions in the United States are by children's foster parents. Beginning as a foster parent is also one way that you may be able to adopt a healthy infant or toddler. But you are not required to be a foster parent in order to adopt.
